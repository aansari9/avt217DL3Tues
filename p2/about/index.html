          <h2> About Us
          </h2>
          <p>The Velvet Velvet features three to four larger shows about graphic design and architecture, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring work from local designers.
          </p>
          <p>Nothing on display will be for sale. The Velvet Velvet is like a free private museum of design scholarship meant to appeal to the whims of its foundersâ€”and hopefully the community.
          </p>
          <p>In addition to the small and larger exhibits, one will find for sale a modest selection of books and magazines about graphic design, typography, and architecture from publishers all over the world.
